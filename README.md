MultiSense AI - Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
A production-ready machine learning system that analyzes customer sentiment using both text content and audio tone. This multimodal approach provides deeper insights into customer feedback compared to traditional single-modality systems.

Features
Text Sentiment Analysis: Processes written feedback using fine-tuned transformer models

Audio Emotion Recognition: Analyzes voice recordings using convolutional neural networks

Combined Analysis: Fuses both modalities for comprehensive sentiment understanding

Production Architecture: Modular, scalable system with proper error handling and caching

Interactive Web Interface: Streamlit application for real-time analysis

Technical Implementation
Text Pipeline: DistilBERT transformer from Hugging Face for sentiment classification

Audio Pipeline: Custom PyTorch CNN processing Mel-spectrograms for emotion recognition

Quantized Models: Optimized for deployment with faster inference and reduced memory usage

Performance: 91.3% text accuracy, 78.4% audio emotion recognition accuracy

Quick Start
